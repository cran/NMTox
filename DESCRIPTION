Description: Perform an exploration and a preliminary analysis on the dose-
    response relationship of nanomaterial toxicity. Several functions are
    provided for data exploration, including functions for creating a subset of
    dataset, frequency tables and plots. Inference for order restricted dose-
    response data is performed by testing the significance of monotonic
    dose-response relationship, using Williams, Marcus, M, Modified M and 
    Likelihood ratio tests. Several methods of multiplicity adjustment 
    are also provided. Description of the methods can be found in <https://github.com/rahmasarina/dose-response-analysis/blob/main/Methodology.pdf>.
